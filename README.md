Bootstrap laptop scripts
========================

Install xcode command line tools without xcode installation:

```
  xcode-select --install
```

A software update popup window will appear that asks: “The xcode-select command requires the command line developer tools. Would you like to install the tools now?” choose to confirm this by clicking “Install”, then agree to the Terms of Service when requested.

Next run ```./laptop.sh```
